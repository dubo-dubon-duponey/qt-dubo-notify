# DuboNotify

A cross-platform notification library for QT with a focus on macOS.

## How to use

1. Build the library (static by default, see project.pri to change it to a shared library if you need)
2. Link it into your app
```
LIBS += -ldubonotify
# If linking statically
DEFINES += LIBDUBONOTIFY_USE_STATIC
```
3. Use it
```
DuboNotify::Notifier * n = new DuboNotify::Notifier(parentObject);
DuboNotify::Notification * notif = new DuboNotify::Notification(n);
notif->Title = "foo";
n->dispatch(notif);
```

For more, see main.cpp in the demo repository.

## Gotchas

1. In order for "actions" to work on notifications, you need to:

    * code-sign your application
    * set NSUserNotificationAlertStyle to "alert" in your application plist

Alternatively, you can manually change the notifications preferences for your application to "alert" in system preferences

2. We do use and expose one private API: _alwaysShowAlternateActionMenu. It allows for AdditionalActions to be more "visible".
